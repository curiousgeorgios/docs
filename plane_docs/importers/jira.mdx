3. In the **Jira to Plane Migration Assistant** screen, enter your **Personal Access Token**, **User email** and the **Jira domain** to allow Plane access to your Atlassian account. ![Connect Jira](/images/importers/importers/jira/jira-plane-migration-assitant.webp)

4. Click the **Connect Jira** button to link the accounts.

5. Click the **Import** button. ![Import Jira](/images/importers/importers/jira/import-jira-data.webp)

   <Info>
     If you're on a paid plan (Pro or higher), issue types in Jira will be imported as work item types in Plane. On the free plan, issue types from Jira won't be imported.
   </Info>

8. **Import users** Choose one of the following:

   * **Upload CSV** Click the **Upload CSV** button to import users to your Plane project. Refer to [Export users from a site](https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/export-users-from-a-site/) to download the CSV file from Jira. *(recommended)*
   * **Skip user import** You can select the **Skip Importing User data** checkbox and manually add users later.
     <Warning>
       If you skip user import, work items and comments will show the name of the person who performed the migration, and the Assignees field will be empty.
     </Warning>
