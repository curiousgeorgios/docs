## Import from Linear[​](#import-from-linear "Direct link to Import from Linear")

> **Role**: Workspace admins

<Check>
  To import issue types from Linear, make sure the [Work item types](/core-concepts/issues/issue-types) feature is enabled in your Plane workspace.
</Check>

To import Linear issues to a Plane project, follow these steps:

1. Click the **∨** icon next to your workspace name on the sidebar and select **Workspace settings**.

2. Select **Imports** on the right pane and click the **Import** button in the Linear section. ![Import Linear](/images/importers/importers/linear/import-linear.webp)

3. In the **Linear to Plane Migration Assistant** screen, enter your **Personal Access Token** to allow Plane access to your Linear account. ![Connect Linear](/images/importers/importers/linear/linear-plane-migration-assistant.webp)

4. Click the **Connect Linear** button to link the accounts.

5. Click the **Import** button in the **Imports** section. ![Import Linear data](/images/importers/importers/linear/import-linear-data.webp)

6. **Configure Plane** Select the Plane project where you want to import your Linear data and and click **Next**. ![Configure Plane](/images/importers/importers/linear/configure-plane.webp)

7. **Configure Linear** Choose the Linear team from where you want to import data. ![Configure Linear](/images/importers/importers/linear/configure-linear.webp)

8. **Map states** Map **Linear states** to their equivalent **Plane states**. ![Map states](/images/importers/importers/linear/map-states.webp)

9. **Summary** Review the mappings and make any changes if needed. Click **Back** to adjust, or click **Confirm** to start the migration. ![Review mappings](/images/importers/importers/linear/import-summary.webp)

10. The data migration begins and takes a few minutes to complete depending on the number of issues in your Linear workspace. ![Migration complete](/images/importers/importers/linear/import-complete.webp)

11. Once it's done, go to **Work items** in your Plane project to confirm that the data import is successful. ![Verify import](/images/importers/importers/linear/verify-import.webp)

## Sync Linear to Plane[​](#sync-linear-to-plane "Direct link to Sync Linear to Plane")

After the import, if there are any new or updated issues in Linear, you can easily sync these changes to Plane:

1. Go to **Workspace settings**.
2. Select **Imports** on the right pane.
3. Click the **Re run** button next to the project you want to sync. ![Sync Linear](/images/importers/importers/linear/rerun-import.webp)
