## Self-hosted only[​](#self-hosted-only "Direct link to Self-hosted only")

<Warning>
  Starting v1.3.0 of our Commercial Edition, your license will need to be activated on a workspace. Each license can be used to activate only one workspace.
</Warning>

<Check>
  Steps #1 through #5 from above work the exact same way on self-hosted, too.
</Check>

1. If your payment goes through, you will be redirected to the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses), your one-stop interface to manage your licenses and buy new ones.
   <Warning>
     You can always directly log into the Prime Portal, especially if you pre-ordered one of our plans, with the same email address you used to purchase one of our paid plans. You will get a code at the same address that will sign you in.
   </Warning>
2. Find the license by the plan you just subscribed to. Copy the **License key** for the license you want to activate. ![Manage licenses](/images/workspaces-and-users/activate-license/copy-license-key.webp)
   <Note>
     Click the Get more licenses button as in the image above on the [Prime portal](https://prime.plane.so/licenses/plans) to buy more licenses.
   </Note>
3. Go back to the **Billing and plans** screen, usually already open in your browser.
4. Click the **Activate this Workspace** button. ![Activate workspace](/images/workspaces-and-users/activate-license/enter-license-key-selfhosted.webp)
5. Paste the license key in the **Enter license key** box.
6. Click **Activate**. You will see a confirmation.
7. That's it. To check your plan at any time and find additional details, just go to the **Billing and plans** tab in **Workspace Settings**. ![Manage subscription](/images/workspaces-and-users/activate-license/pro-activated-cloud.webp)

### Delink license key[​](#delink-license-key "Direct link to Delink license key")

Your license key is linked to both a workspace and an instance, meaning it can only be used on one workspace on one machine at a time. If you switch machines or reinstall the Commercial edition, you’ll need to reactivate your workspace. This helps prevent any misuse of the license on multiple machines or workspaces.

To make it easier for you to move between machines or workspaces, we've added a new Delink feature. This lets you free up your license from its current workspace, so you can reuse it on a new machine or workspace.

Here’s how to delink your license key from a workspace:

1. Head over to the **Billing and Plans** screen of the workspace that's currently using the license.
2. Click **Delink license key**. This will release the license key, making it available for use on another machine or workspace. ![Delink license key](/images/workspaces-and-users/activate-license/delink-license-key.webp)
3. Restart the instance using `prime-cli restart`.
4. If you’re switching machines or reinstalling the Commercial edition, see [Move Plane instance to another server](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/manage/migrate-plane).
5. Ensure you are connected to the internet and reactivate the new workspace using the license key you delinked earlier.

## Manage paid users[​](#manage-paid-users "Direct link to Manage paid users")

You can always reassign or adjust seats as your team’s needs change. Here’s how to add or remove paid seats:

1. Open your [workspace settings](/core-concepts/workspaces/overview#workspace-settings) and navigate to the **Members** screen.
2. You’ll see a **Manage Seats** button. ![Manage seats](/images/workspaces-and-users/activate-license/manage-seats.webp)

Clicking this will give you two choices:

* **Add seats** If you need more seats, click **Add seats**. A modal will appear where you can specify the number of additional paid seats you want to add. Once you’ve entered the number, click **Change**. You’ll be redirected to the Stripe payment portal to complete the payment for the new seats.

![Add seats](/images/workspaces-and-users/activate-license/add-paid-seats.webp)

* **Remove unused seats** Any paid seat that isn’t currently assigned to a user is considered unused and can be reassigned at any time. If you no longer need these unused seats and want to stop paying for them, click **Remove unused seats**. This will automatically remove all paid but unused seats from your workspace.
