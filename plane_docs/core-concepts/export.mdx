title: "Export work items to backup, analyze, or share your data"
description: "Plane allows you to export all your work items—from a single project or multiple projects—so you can access your data outside of Plane. You can export work items into CSV, Excel, or JSON formats. Additionally, you can choose how you'd like the data to be packaged: in a single consolidated file or split into separate files (downloaded as a ZIP)."

<Warning>
  All key fields related to your work items are included in the export, except for work item types, custom properties, relations, links, attachments, and estimates. We're actively working on adding these soon.
