## Turn on Pages[​](#turn-on-pages "Direct link to Turn on Pages")

To change a page’s visibility, just go to the **•••** menu on that page anytime. ![Public or private pages](/images/core-concepts/pages/pages/public-private-page.webp)

## Add content[​](#add-content "Direct link to Add content")

* Once you've created a page, you can add content using the `/` command, which supports 16 different content blocks from lists to images to tables to work item embeds, giving you the flexibility to structure your content exactly how you need it. For a full list of content blocks and to explore each one in detail, see [Editor blocks](/core-concepts/pages/editor-blocks).

  ![Slash commands](/images/core-concepts/pages/pages/slash-commands.webp)

The static toolbar at the top of the page offers a range of styling options for your content, basic blocks like headings and lists and advanced blocks like images, tables, and more.

* Quickly adjust headings (H1-H6) to create a clear, structured hierarchy in your document.
* Add emphasis with text or background colors, and style important information with bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough options for better readability.
* Align your content to the left, right, or center to ensure proper layout and visual balance in your document.

### Markdown support[​](#markdown-support "Direct link to Markdown support")

Plane allows you to use Markdown in Pages, making it easy to format content quickly with familiar Markdown syntax. You can create headings, lists, links, and other common formats right in your page without switching to a separate editor.

To use Markdown in Plane, simply type the relevant symbols (like # for headings or - for lists) directly within the page. Plane will automatically convert your Markdown into the appropriate format, helping you keep your workflow smooth and efficient.

### Table of contents[​](#table-of-contents "Direct link to Table of contents")

![TOC and Info panel](/images/core-concepts/pages/pages/toc-info-panel.webp)

Pages come with a built-in TOC, which helps you navigate through sections easily. You can toggle this feature on or off depending on your preference, ensuring you have quick access to the relevant content.

### Info panel[​](#info-panel "Direct link to Info panel")

The Info panel provides metadata, showing the word count, character count, paragraph count, and reading time helping you manage and understand your document at a glance.

### Duplicate or delete block[​](#duplicate-or-delete-block "Direct link to Duplicate or delete block")

![Duplicate or delete block](/images/core-concepts/pages/pages/delete-duplicate-block.webp)

![Version history](/images/core-concepts/pages/pages/version-history.webp)

Pages includes a version history feature that lets you track all updates and edits made to a document. This is especially helpful when multiple users are collaborating, as you can easily see who made changes and when. Plus, you can restore the page to a previous version if needed.

### Export Page[​](#export-page "Direct link to Export Page")

![Export Page](/images/core-concepts/pages/pages/export-page.webp)

Pages lets you export your content in various formats, including PDF and Markdown. This feature is a game-changer for project managers and team members who need to share information with stakeholders, clients, or team members who might not be using Plane.

When you export to PDF, your documents keep their formatting, making them easy to share and print without any hassle. If you choose to export to Markdown, you can seamlessly integrate your content into other tools or platforms, streamlining your workflow.

## Publish Page[​](#publish-page "Direct link to Publish Page")

Pro

![Publish Page](/images/core-concepts/pages/pages/publish-page.webp)

With Plane, you can publish Pages to the web, making them accessible to anyone with the link—no login required. This feature is perfect for sharing project updates, documentation, or any other information with external stakeholders. Published pages allow viewers to engage directly by leaving comments, providing an open channel for feedback without needing access to your workspace.

To publish a page, click the **Publish** button at the top right of your screen. You’ll receive a unique link to share the page.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### Page content not visible[​](#page-content-not-visible "Direct link to Page content not visible")

**Issue** Page content is not visible to Members, even when the page is set to public. While the page title appears, the content does not, and only the page creator can view it. In some cases, content is visible on certain pages but not others, making the issue inconsistent and unpredictable.

**Cause** When using an external reverse proxy, the necessary HTTP upgrade headers must be added to support WebSocket communication. The default configuration does not handle WebSocket connections correctly.

**Solution** To resolve this issue, enable WebSocket support by adding specific headers in your external proxy configuration file.

For example, if you are using NGINX, include the following settings:

```
proxy_http_version 1.1;proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
```

For more details on configuring an external reverse proxy for Plane and accessing different templates, refer to the [External reverse proxy](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/reverse-proxy) guide.
