title: "Manage users, roles, and permissions"
description: "Keeping your workspace organized and secure is essential for smooth project management. Plane makes it easy to control who can access your workspace, what they can do, and how they collaborate with others. This guide will walk you through managing members, assigning roles, and understanding the permissions associated with each role."
---

## Roles[​](#roles "Direct link to Roles")

Each user in your workspace has a role, which defines their level of access and permissions. Here’s a quick overview of the available roles:

* **Admin** Admins have full access to everything in the workspace. They can manage members, update settings, and perform all actions across projects, cycles, and modules. If you're an admin, you’re essentially running the show.

* **Member** Members are your core team. They can create, edit, and delete content in projects, cycles, and modules. Members also can create new projects. This role works well for collaborators who need to contribute to day-to-day tasks.

* **Guest** Guests are external collaborators—like clients or contractors—who need limited access. They can only view the specific content they’ve been invited to. This role is perfect for keeping outsiders in the loop without giving them full access.

### Grant view access to Guests[​](#grant-view-access-to-guests "Direct link to Grant view access to Guests")

You can turn on this setting in **Project Settings > Members**. Enabling this setting allows guest users to view all project work items, providing them with broader visibility into the project's progress and details. This is useful for external stakeholders who need full context without editing permissions. ![Grant guest users view access](/images/core-concepts/workspaces/workspaces/grant-guests-view-access.webp)

## Permissions[​](#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

Permissions define what actions users can take within a workspace or project. By assigning appropriate roles, you can ensure everyone has the right level of access to collaborate effectively while maintaining security.

## Manage Members[​](#manage-members "Direct link to Manage Members")

You can manage the members in your workspace by navigating to **Workspace settings > Members**.

### Add member[​](#add-member "Direct link to Add member")

![Invite user](/images/core-concepts/workspaces/workspaces/add-user.webp)

1. Click on **Add member**. This opens a modal where you can:

   1. Enter the email addresses of the user you’re inviting.
   2. Assign the role to **Admin**, **Member**, or **Guest**.
   3. Click **Add another** to add multiple users.
   4. Finally, click the **Invite** button.

Once invited, members receive an email notification.

<Warning>
  Ensure your SMTP server is properly configured to send invite emails successfully. See [Email](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/communication) for more information.
</Warning>

After the user accepts the invitation, they’ll be added to the workspace. If they don’t accept or decline, you can manually remove the pending invitation.

### Update member roles[​](#update-member-roles "Direct link to Update member roles")

![Update user role](/images/core-concepts/workspaces/workspaces/update-user.webp)

1. Locate the member whose role you want to update.
2. Use the role dropdown to promote or demote their role.

Admins can update any member's role, while regular members can only promote others to the Member role.

### Remove member[​](#remove-member "Direct link to Remove member")

![Remove user](/images/core-concepts/workspaces/workspaces/remove-user.webp)

1. Find the member you want to remove.
2. Click the **Remove** option next to their name.

Once removed, they’ll immediately lose access to the workspace and its projects.
