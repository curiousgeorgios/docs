With Teamspaces, you can mirror your real-world teams of any kind and track work separately from a project. Link projects, see your team's work automatically filtered across projects, and house your team's knowledge separate from anything else in Plane.

## What is Teamspaces?[​](#what-is-teamspaces "Direct link to What is Teamspaces?")

Teamspaces brings together people and projects in a neat space tucked away from all else in Plane, offering you an overview of your teams' work. Track work items across projects, manage multiple cycles, share views and pages, and chat with team members—all without jumping around from one screen to another.

![Team progress](/images/core-concepts/workspaces/teams/team-progress.webp)

Here's a breakdown of its components:

* **Overdue Work items** A red-highlighted banner at the top shows the count of overdue work items, emphasizing the urgency to address them. This feature encourages timely action to meet deadlines and reduce project delays.

* **Progress chart** A bar chart displays the progress of work items categorized by selected criteria, such as Priority, Due Date, or Start Date. Users can toggle between these views using the dropdown menu to focus on specific aspects of the team's work. Each bar is segmented to show the percentage of completed and pending work items, offering a quick comparison.

**Blocking** This tab displays work items that are currently blocking other tasks, potentially causing delays in your team’s workflow.

**Blocked** This tab would display work items that are blocked by others. It helps in identifying bottlenecks and ensuring timely resolution to keep tasks moving.

## Team stats[​](#team-stats "Direct link to Team stats")

This section provides a high-level view of tasks across multiple projects or teams. It visualizes work items in a treemap format, where each section represents a project, and the size of each block is proportional to the number of work items.

![Team stats](/images/core-concepts/workspaces/teams/team-stats.webp)

You can group the stats based on filters like Projects, Members, State Groups, Dependency, and Due By to focus on specific areas of work.

A legend at the bottom categorizes work items by their state or priority, making it easier to understand their progress.

This feature helps you quickly assess the distribution of workload, identify where resources are focused, and monitor the health of ongoing efforts.

## Teams info[​](#teams-info "Direct link to Teams info")

The Info tab on the right serves as a centralized space to view key details and linked entities.
