Without a centralized project view, teams often face challenges like fragmented information, inefficient progress tracking, and communication gaps.

Project Overview offers a centralized space for teams to monitor project health, track progress, and collaborate effectively. It consolidates key project metrics, updates, and collaboration tools into a single view. Whether you're a project lead, team member, or stakeholder, this feature provides the visibility you need to stay informed and aligned.

## Access project overview[‚Äã](#access-project-overview "Direct link to Access project overview")
