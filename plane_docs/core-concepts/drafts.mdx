title: "Save your progress in Drafts"
description: "We've all been there—clicking outside a modal or navigating away from a page, only to lose all our progress. With Drafts, you don’t have to worry about that anymore. If you're interrupted when writing a work item or a comment or accidentally click away, Plane automatically saves your half-written text so you can pick up right where you left off."

## How Drafts work[​](#how-drafts-work "Direct link to How Drafts work")

<Info>
  Drafts remain private and won't be visible to team members until you move them to project work items.
</Info>

As soon as you start writing a work item, Plane auto-saves it for you. Should you stop midway or click away to a notification, all your work items, and soon, comments, are available in **Drafts** accessible from the sidebar. Find your draft from the preview text, edit it, delete it, or move the draft to a project when you're ready.

Additionally, if you try to close the **Create work item** modal, you’ll see a confirmation box offering you the option to save it to Drafts. ![Save to drafts](/images/core-concepts/drafts/save-to-drafts.webp)

## Create drafts manually[​](#create-drafts-manually "Direct link to Create drafts manually")

Just click **Draft a work item** at the top right of your **Drafts** screen, and write out a draft that you will pick up later.

* **Edit** Select **Edit** to make changes to your draft as you would with a regular work item. Once you're done, just save your updates.

* **Make a copy** Need a duplicate? Simply select **Make a copy** to clone your draft.

* **Move to project** Ready to finalize your draft? Click **Move to project** to publish it as a regular work item. A confirmation modal will appear, giving you a chance to review it one last time. Assignees and team members will be notified only once the draft is moved to the project.

* **Delete** Created a draft you no longer need? Deleting it is easy. Click **Delete**, confirm, and it’s gone. A toast message will appear confirming the deletion.

  <Warning>
    Keep in mind, deleted drafts cannot be recovered. You'll always see a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions.
  </Warning>
