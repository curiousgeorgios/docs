## Set up your Workspace[​](#set-up-your-workspace "Direct link to Set up your Workspace")

When you sign up for the first time on Plane, we'll prompt you to create a new Workspace. In this guide, you'll see how to customize the Workspace and invite your team members. Your workspace is the central hub where all your projects and team collaboration will happen, so let’s make it feel like home.

## Create Projects and Work items[​](#create-projects-and-work-items "Direct link to Create Projects and Work items")

Now that your workspace is ready, it’s time to create your first project. Projects keep all related tasks and work items organized in one place, making it easy to focus on specific goals. In this step, you’ll set up a project and add work items with basic properties to get your team started on their tasks.

## Create and track Cycles[​](#create-and-track-cycles "Direct link to Create and track Cycles")

In this final step, you’ll learn how to organize your work into cycles—time-bound periods for managing tasks like sprints. Cycles help you track progress, prioritize tasks, and stay on top of deadlines. Here, you’ll create cycles, add work items, and learn how to track your team’s work over time.
