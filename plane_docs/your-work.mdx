You can click the tabs to navigate to different categories and filter your assigned, created and subscribed work items.

## Summary[​](#summary "Direct link to Summary")

At the top, the **Overview** section provides high-level metrics about the work assigned to you. You can quickly see the number of work items you've created, the ones currently assigned to you, and the total number of work items you're subscribed to, even if they aren't directly assigned.

These top-level statistics give you a quick sense of your involvement and level of engagement with the projects.

### Workload[​](#workload "Direct link to Workload")

Moving down, the Workload visualization breaks down your current tasks by their status:

* **Backlog** - Work items that are waiting to be started
* **Not started** - Tasks that are ready for you to begin work
* **Working on** - Work items you are actively addressing
* **Completed** - Tasks you have finished
* **Cancelled** - Any work items that have been cancelled

This at-a-glance view allows you to immediately identify where most of your time and effort is currently focused.

### Work items by priority and state[​](#work-items-by-priority-and-state "Direct link to Work items by priority and state")

You can see a breakdown of the tasks assigned to you organized by their designated priority level. The **Work items by state** pie chart gives you a holistic view of how your assigned tasks are progressing through the workflow.

### Recent activity[​](#recent-activity "Direct link to Recent activity")

This section keeps a chronological log of your most recent actions within your projects.

By consolidating all of this valuable information into a single, centralized dashboard, the **Your Work** page empowers you to effectively oversee and prioritize your individual tasks and progress within the workspace.
