title: Private links
---

As you may already know, the event types have their own URLs which you can share with your potential attendees. But if you want to prevent attendees from seeing your [Cal.com](http://cal.com/) username that leads directly to your booking page, you can use this feature to generate a single-use private link.

This private link regenerates after each use, so your attendees wonâ€™t be able to use this URL to book your time again. You will find a quick copy button for the private links on the right-hand side of the event-type dashboard.

Besides the privacy that it can provide, this feature can also help you prevent your [Cal.com](http://cal.com/) username from being shared around and to better manage the incoming booking requests. However, if you need to share a private link to multiple people, you can generate multiple private links for a single event , as shown in the demo below.
