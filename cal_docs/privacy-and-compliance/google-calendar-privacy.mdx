### Data We Access: Only Free/Busy Information

Cal.com uses the [Google Calendar Free/Busy API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/v3/reference/freebusy/query) to retrieve availability information. This means that we only access data on whether you are free or busy at a given time â€“ no specific event details, titles, locations, or any other personal information is accessed or stored.

### Compliance and Security

We take compliance and security very seriously. For more information on our security practices, please visit [cal.com/security](https://cal.com/security).

### Code Reference

For those interested in seeing exactly how this works, you can view our code on GitHub, where we explicitly do not access any event details.
